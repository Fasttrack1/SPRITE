Click the Create button at the top of the page.
The system displays the Create new repository page. Take some time to review the dialog's contents. With the exception of the Repository type, everything you enter on this page you can later change.
Enter bb101repo for the Name field.
Bitbucket uses this Name in the URL for your repository. For example, the username atlassian_tutorial has a repository name jira-applinks, the full URL for that repository is https://bitbucket.org/atlassian_tutorial/jira-applinks. You can use the URL to quickly navigate to a repository overview.
Enter a short Description.
For Access level, leave the This is a private repository box checked.
A private repository is only visible to you and those you give access to (more about this later). If this box is unchecked, everyone can see your repository.
Check Git for the repository type.
You can't change the repository type once you pick one. For this tutorial, we create a Git repository first. Later we will work with a Mecurial repository.
For Project management, check both the Issue tracking and Wiki checkbox.
Set the Language field to HTML/CSS.
Click Create repository.
Bitbucket creates your repository and displays the repository Overview page.
